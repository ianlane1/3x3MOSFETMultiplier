# This is a 3 x 3 bit multiplier using nothing but NMOS transistors created and designed by Ian Lane
# The purpose of this github repository is to have all filed I have worked on in one place for anyone interested or for people looking at my resume to see what I am capable of
# NMOS logic.asc is an LTspice schematic showing how I created logical AND, OR, and XOR out of N channel MOSFET
# MOSFET Testing.asc is an LTspice schematic showing the full working design of the multiplier
# MOSFET_Multilpier_Testing.ino is an Arduino code that I will use to do full scale testing on the fully built breadboard version of my schematics
# No full scale testing has been done yet only because I do not have the parts to do the project and am waiting until around 12/25/2024. After which I should be uploading full scale testing of this project.
