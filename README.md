- This is a 3 x 3 bit multiplier using nothing but NMOS transistors created and designed by Ian Lane
- The purpose of this github repository is to have all filed I have worked on in one place for anyone interested or for people looking at my resume to see what I am capable of
- NMOS logic.asc is an LTspice schematic showing how I created logical AND, OR, and XOR out of N channel MOSFET
- MOSFET Testing.asc is an LTspice schematic showing the full working design of the multiplier
- MOSFET_Multilpier_Testing.ino is an Arduino code that I will use to do full scale testing on the fully built breadboard version of my schematics

- The updated version that can handle single bit multiplication has not been created but does work, the Karatsuba.cpp is the base code that would be implemented with the design to fully functional single bit multiplier
